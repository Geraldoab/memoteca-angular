# memoteca-angular

A SPA project built with Angular 14+ and Typescript for you to save some thoughts or ideas that are important to you. This project was a requirement
for the conclusion of an Angular 14 course that I finished on [Alura Courses Platform](https://cursos.alura.com.br/certificate/d3bab0f4-cae5-4cbc-b2e0-3228b6b4d441?lang=en)
